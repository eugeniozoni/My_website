abstract: Therapy resistance is a major roadblock in oncology. Exacerbation of molecular dysfunctions typical of cancer cells have proven effective in twisting oncogenic mechanisms to lethal conditions, thus offering new therapeutic avenues for cancer treatment. Here, we demonstrate that selective agonists of Transient Receptor Potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8), a cation channel characteristic of the prostate epithelium frequently overexpressed in advanced stage III/IV prostate cancers (PCa), sensitize therapy refractory models of PCa to radio, chemo or hormonal treatment. Overall, our study demonstrates that pharmacological-induced Ca2+ cytotoxicity is an actionable strategy to sensitize cancer cells to standard therapies.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

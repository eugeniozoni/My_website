I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [**Urology Research Laboratory**](https://www.urogenus-research.org/), Department for BioMedical Research, University of Bern. My research interests include cancer biology, metabolomics and data analysis and visualization.

Beside research, I like to fix things and set-up small mechanical projects to maintain my car and motorcycle. I also like to work on home improvement to refurbish and maximize spaces in our tiny apartment.

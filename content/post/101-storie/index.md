**CIAO ITALIA! 101 stories of Italians emigrated abroad in the 21st century**

My story, together with the ones of other 100 young Italians emigrated abroad in the last 10 years, was presented in [**this book**](https://www.mindedizioni.com/libri/ciao-italia/) (in Italian) and published early in 2020. The book was authored by [**Enzo Riboni**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enzo-riboni-5a7a565/) and covers our stories, from that first *one way ticket* to the present. Many of us are still abroad, but some returned to Italy.


After publication, it was picked up by different Italian media and reviewed by the Italian newspaper [**La Stampa**](https://www.lastampa.it/economia/lavoro/2020/02/18/news/ciao-italia-ecco-101-storie-di-cervelli-in-fuga-1.38484616) and [**Radio Capital**](https://www.capital.it/programmi/cactus-basta-poca-acqua/puntate/cactus-basta-poca-acqua-del-10-02-2020/?fbclid=IwAR3Y1PV534v14KhiyRskIIjUZA-CGAyIFK6lmys_B_iG1kNpDEa_DwT24Co). 


In [**this video**](https://www.facebook.com/LiucUniversitaCattaneo/videos/178773946719192/), the author presents the book after publication. The book is available [**here**](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/8869393240/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0).

**When time comes for a PhD student to write his thesis in Holland, this has to be formatted in a very particular way and the final result is a real book!**

In case you are interested in knowing more about my PhD studies and want to have a look at the *boekje* (little book) as the Dutch like to call it, you can download it from [**here**](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research/research-output/medicine-lumc/novel-regulators-of-prostate-cancer-stem-cells-and-tumor-aggressiveness).

**My work and life experience as Italian immigrant in the Netherlands**

The interview was published on May 3, 2016 in [**Corriere della Sera**](https://www.corriere.it/economia/trovolavoro/16_maggio_03/asse-olanda-svizzera-curriculum-eugenio-df7a4e08-111f-11e6-950d-3d35834ec81d.shtml) (article in Italian). I discussed with [**Enzo Riboni**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enzo-riboni-5a7a565/) my work and life experience in the Netherlands, where I moved for my PhD in 2012.

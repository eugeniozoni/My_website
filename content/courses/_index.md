## Overview

This section includes different personal projects and contents such as:

* **Data analysis with R**
* **Data visualization with R**
* **Tutorials**
* **This website**

The aim of this section is to provide a tool to share my knowledge with the community and receive inputs and feedback on my work. The codes and raw data for each project are available on [**my GitHub repositories**](https://github.com/eugeniozoni). 

## Data analysis with R

The **aim** of this section is to share with you some examples of codes for data analysis that I have assembled for different type of data. 

## Data visualization with R

In this section I have combined some small projects aimed to visualize different type of data. This is mainly a graphic section, where I provide some codes to look at certain data from a **qualitative** point of view.

## Tutorials

Here you will find some basic codes to customize your data. This section is intended as a **cheat sheet** for basic R functions which I think are of interest when approaching R for this first time to prepare your data before ready for processing.

## This Website

In this section I present the project aimed to build and customize **this website.**

The aim of this Research Topic is to collect the latest advances in targeting cancer metabolism by using near-patient models such as organoids and ex-vivo models recapitulating tumor heterogeneity.

Specific themes we would like to address are on the following non-exhaustive list:
- Metabolic heterogeneity in primary and metastatic urological cancers
- Targeting cancer metabolism in urological cancers
- Model systems for the study of cancer metabolism
- Model systems for personalized medicine in urological cancers
- Lipid metabolism in urological cancers

We welcome the submission of all article types, including but not limited to Original Research, Review, Mini-Review, Methods, Protocols and Hypothesis and Theory articles.
